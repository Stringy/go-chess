//Package gen is responsible for generating a list of moves for a particular game state.
//It uses bitboards to contain the information regarding each piece type and a single 32 bit integer
//to contain movement information. It is only designed to generate from a single state, to a depth of one.
//Any further than this must be extended outside of this package. 
package gen

// init Initialises all global data including attack masks
func init() {
	InitAllData()        //init globals
	InitialiseAllMasks() //init attack masks
}
